**Many thanks to them and all my [donors](#donations)üôèüèª** 

This project is a little [DRADIS](https://en.battlestarwikiclone.org/wiki/DRADIS) simulator on M5Stack. Use cases ? None ! It's just for fun üòé Note that this project works best with the M5GO/M5GO2 module (if you want to take advantage of the Cylon eye scanner...).

# Usage

Use left and right buttons to adjust brightness. Use the middle button to hear [Cylon Eye Scanner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv3dUc_G4a0) and change theme (Grey, Blue, Sepia).

# Compilation

First, edit `platformio.ini` file and change `default_envs` target :

- `default_envs = core` for Core, 
- `default_envs = core2` for Core2
- `default_envs = cores3` for Core S3.

You can compile the source code and flash your M5Stack.

Remember to upload the FileSystem Image too (the `/data` folder content videos, images and wav). If you don't know how to upload the FileSystem Image, take a look at this [tutorial](https://www.donskytech.com/how-to-upload-filesystem-image-in-platformio-ide/).
